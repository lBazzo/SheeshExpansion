**`pokehns-expansion`** is a GBA ROM hack base that equips developers with a comprehensive toolkit for creating Pokémon ROM hacks. It provides a base with the Johto and Kanto regions.
**`pokehns-expansion`** is built on top of [RHH's `pokeemerald-expansion`](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion), which is itself built from [pret's `pokeemerald`](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) decompilation project, with features from [`pokemonHnS`](https://github.com/PokemonHnS-Development/pokemonHnS) integrated. **On its own it is a clone of pokemonHnS with the capability to add later-generation features.**
